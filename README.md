# Practice Dart

Credits go to Michele Pratusevich, who is the author of [**Practice Python**](https://www.practicepython.org). 

All the exercises are adopted from there. The exercises that are too Python specific are omitted. 

New exercises will be added over time.

Solutions are given in [Dart language](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour), and confirmed to be working in version 2.9.0 of the SDK on Windows 10, as well as on [Repl.it](https://repl.it).
